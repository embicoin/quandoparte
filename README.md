Quando Parte
============

Quando Parte (_Italian: When is it leaving?_) is a program designed to quickly
check (Italian) railway timetables and delays at train stations you use. It is
based on the viaggiatreno.it service of the Trenitalia railways operator, and
on train station data collected by Openstreetmap.

The aim of the program is to be a quick tool to manage your time when
commuting. It remembers the stations you are interested in, and you can quickly
look them up to see if the service is working regularly.
