			<p><b>Quando Parte</b> (Italian: <i>When is it leaving?</i>) is a program designed to quickly check
			(Italian) railways timetables and delays at train stations you use. It is
			based on the 
			<a href="http://mobile.viaggiatreno.it/viaggiatreno/mobile">viaggiatreno.it</a>
			service of the Trenitalia Italian railways operator, and on
			train station data collected by 
			<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">Openstreetmap</a>.</p>
			<p>The aim of the program is to be a quick tool to manage
			your time when commuting; timetable lookup and other
			informations may come at a later stage, but they are
			out of the initial scope of the project.</p>
			<p>The project is young, a few features have yet to be written. More informations are coming!</p>
			<p>The initial version is for the 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N900">Nokia N900</a>, 
			there may soon be ports to other platforms where the Qt libraries are available.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The program is maintained in the <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/quandoparte/">Maemo Garage</a>.<p>
